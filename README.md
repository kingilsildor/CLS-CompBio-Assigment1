# CLS-CompBio-Assigment1
This assignment involves enzyme kinetics and metabolic modeling. It requires identifying the enzyme kinetics mechanism, plotting Eadie-Hofstee and Lineweaver-Burk graphs, and extracting Michaelis constants. Additionally, it includes modeling the TCA cycle, solving steady-state equations, applying MM kinetics, and analyzing solution constraints.
